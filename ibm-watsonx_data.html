						<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<!-- start here -->
							<p>Business-to-business software, especially products used by technical users, is increasingly adopting aspects of product-led growth (PLG). IBM's data lakehouse product, watsonx.data, adopted the model but wasn't seeing the conversion or even engagement with the product, they'd anticipated. This study, while succinct, uncovered 4 major recommendations and resulted in 20% more Trial plan sign-ups month-over-month (MoM), a 200% increase in accounts with daily rated usage (DRU), and contributed to the 320% increase enterprise plan instances MoM</p>
						<h2 id="objective">Objectives</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Identify challenges that data engineers face when getting started with IBMâ€™s data lakehouse</li>
							</ul>
						<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
							<p>My team and I used IBM enterprise design thinking to understand the problem space. We all (Design and UX research) spent the first week asking questions. We spoke to people who spoke with customers (for example, salespeople and customer support) in the spirit of moving fast. Also, to speed up our process, I worked directly with the designers to devise a research plan Meanwhile within our broader, cross-functional team, we worked out our assumptions and questions about the problem space. </p>
							<p> In the second week, my designer colleagues started prototyping based on the needs we heard articulated during the first week. I spent that time coding interviews from the first week in preparation for our presentation to our cross-functional team. My research lead spent the time reading secondary research so as to compile every bit of information possible about Third Party Risk Management (TPRM), our competitors, and the market opportunity. Together, we used his work and my understanding of the research, as gathered through coding interviews.</p>
						<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
							<p>The two week jam culminated in a presentation to our Product Managers, mainly, but also to the rest of our cross-functional, interdisciplinary team. (In other words, Engineering, Sales, and whoever wanted to be there was also invited.)
						<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
							<p>The jam was meant to be just an exploration of TPRM; however, our research uncovered that the real root of the problem surrounding this next market venture was a then-neglected feature of the product: the questionnaire. We were able to prove that point and get questionnaires on the roadmap for the year, ultimately resulting in an updated questionnaire with release 8.3.</p>
