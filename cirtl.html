							  <h3>Summary</h3>
                  <p>In the last few years, several movements in America have sought to bring attention 
                  to issues of race, gender, and sexual orientation</span>. For example, Black Lives Matter 
                  reminded us that treatment of people of color is not yet where it should be.</p>

                  <p>Academia is no different than the rest of the country. For a variety of reasons, 
                  the number of underrepresented racial minority (URM) students who choose to become 
                  professors is tiny. But, this trend is not unnoticed. The Center for the Integration 
                  of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) continues to seek answers to this issue, 
                  <em>retention</em>. (For more information, visit the 
                  <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1647119">NSF Award site</a>.)</p>
                  
                  <p>CIRTL hopes to use informative workshops to improve the experiences of and increase 
                  retention for URM students. To assess any change, the CIRTL team needed to see and understand 
                  the numbers. My job was to design data visualizations which summarized data from the annual 
                  surveys and the workshops. I approached the project as though I were creating visuals for my 
                  own data set.</p>

                <h3>Design Method</h3>
                <em>Problems</em>
                <ol>
                	<li>What data visualizations will answer the most questions for CIRTL?</li>
                	<li>What level of interactivity should be included in the base data dashboard?</li>
                </ol>

                <em>Information Collection</em>
                <p>I used a combination of interviewing and research to collect information about the project. 
                Scouring the NSF Grant, I learned that the project focused on URM student interest in faculty 
                careers. I also discovered that the main areas of interest related to faculty careers and 
                teacher or researcher self-efficacy. I prioritized the variables that appeared in the NSF 
                Grant as I generated ideas.</p>

                <p>After I gathered initial information from the NSF Grant, I approached the team with 
                requirements questions. I wanted to know how the team would know if a workshop intervention 
                had worked. I also needed to determine the audience. (Would the data dashboards stay internal, 
                or would university administrators see them?) If I could do this again, I would have made 
                some very rough mock-ups, even at such an early point in the process. Despite not being as 
                prepared as I could have been, I did have a better idea of where I was headed.</p>

                <div></div>
                <em>Idea Generation</em>
                <p>First, I printed copies of the project's survey questions. I then wrote scale names, 
                question categories, etc. on post-it notes and arranged them into a sort of affinity 
                diagram. Physically grouping the variables aided my discovery of potential relationships 
                in the data. Below is a picture of the affinity diagram for the graduate student annual survey.</p>

                <em>Solution Development</em>
                <p>Because I was new to Tableau and needed to work fast and without data, I chose to 
                reference Tableau and mock-up dashboards. First, I sketched a sample of potential 
                graphs that could be included in a prototype. </p>

	</div>
</div>		

                <div></div>
                <em>Gather Feedback</em>

                After gaining some initial feedback regarding the effectiveness of the graphs, I 
                created higher fidelity mock-ups in PowerPoint. I could have used Axure or Balsamiq 
                to make the prototypes, but I chose PowerPoint to streamline the future presentation 
                of the visualizations</p>.
			
		<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/AnnualSurvey_pies.jpg" alt="Annual Survey mock-up"/></span></div>

                <p>These PowerPoint decks were used to solidify design requirements with the members 
                of CIRTL. I wanted to rapidly prototype my ideas in a way that delineated the idea 
                without further fostering a connection between me and my "masterpieces."</p>

		<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/AnnualSurvey_pies-interaction.jpg" alt="Annual survey interaction mock-up""/></span></div>
 
                <p>Because I was working in PowerPoint, interactivity was easier explained than 
                shown. Needing only to know what relationships they wanted to explore, I didn't 
                want the stakeholders to get held-up in how the interaction looked.</p>
                
                <p>One surprising bit of feedback I received was about the exclusion of the gender 
                demographics variable. I had assumed that since it was not the goal of the project 
                to learn about the experiences of people with different genders, this variable did 
                not have a place in the visualizations. The stakeholders wanted to identify <u>all</u> 
                barriers to retention in faculty career paths. Therefore, if any gender-related 
                issues were present, they wanted to be able to address them.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, the team pointed out that I had included others when a question 
                had a text-response to follow the selection of the other response. While I had 
                assumed that the individual detail would not be important and wanted to simplify 
                data organization, the stakeholders wanted to be able to address all data, not just
                the "aggregates."</p>

                <div></div>
                <em>Improve</em>
                <p>Due to a lapse in funding, I did not improve the visualizations beyond the first 
                draft. From this point, the plan had been to get the data frame to talk to Tableau, 
                then to collect data, and then to implement the gathered design requirements. If I 
                had continued on the project, I would have at least sketched the ideas I had for 
                improving each dashboard. Instead, I wrote out the ideas I had for each dashboard, 
                listed the action items, and consolidated my notes. I enclosed all that information 
                in an email to the team so that when they were ready, they could use my knowledge to 
                speed up their process.</p>
                
                <div></div>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Learning to be a designer</li>
                    <p>Going into this project, I had no formal experience as a designer. 
                    From my perspective, this was a disadvantage, for if I had a better 
                    appreciation for design standards and process, I might have been able to 
                    deliver a more put-together final product. Instead, when I left at the end 
                    of the summer, I had a list of requirements and some prototype visualizations.</p>
                   <li>Eliciting design requirements from stakeholders</li>
                    <p>As I was a naïve UX designer, I completely underestimated the effort I would
                    need to put into eliciting design requirements from the CIRTL members. I eventually 
                    did gain some feedback, but I had to develop a product before I got any comments. 
                    As I move forward, I will rely less on language and more on prototypes and sketches.</p>
                  <li>Learning to embrace failure</li>
                    <p>I had no idea how difficult it was to offer designs up for true critique. 
                    I had taken a few art classes which included critiques, but they had been 
                    relatively tame. I quickly learned that I was designing for failure, rather 
                    than for perfection. I had to take chances and make best-guesses if I wanted 
                    to learn anything from my designs.</p>
                   </ol>
