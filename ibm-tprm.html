						<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
							<p>There are a variety of potential security risks which face down every company, and as those companies grow and start to solicit third parties for a variety of services, managing those risks becomes more difficult and mistakes more costly. During the three-week design jam, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and internal proxy users, as well as secondary research were leveraged to understand the third party risk management process both as envisioned by the product managers and as currently practiced. The findings of the secondary and primary research were leveraged in the creation of a prototype by UX design teammates and the formulation of a research roadmap for evaluating outstanding assumptions and questions. The lean research done during this Jam influenced the development of an upcoming IBM product, including the course of the research surrounding that release.</p>
						<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Security risks, which compound as companies work with third parties in an ecosystem of digital technology, must be managed to avoid loss of data, market leverage, and money.</li>
							</ul>
						<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
							<p>My team and I used IBM enterprise design thinking to understand the problem space. We all (Design and UX research) spent the first week asking questions. We spoke to people who spoke with customers (for example, salespeople and customer support) in the spirit of moving fast. Also, to speed up our process, I worked directly with the designers to devise a research plan Meanwhile within our broader, cross-functional team, we worked out our assumptions and questions about the problem space. </p>
							<p> In the second week, my designer colleagues started prototyping based on the needs we heard articulated during the first week. I spent that time coding interviews from the first week in preparation for our presentation to our cross-functional team. My research lead spent the time reading secondary research so as to compile every bit of information possible about Third Party Risk Management (TPRM), our competitors, and the market opportunity. Together, we used his work and my understanding of the research, as gathered through coding interviews.</p>
						<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
							<p>The two week jam culminated in a presentation to our Product Managers, mainly, but also to the rest of our cross-functional, interdisciplinary team. (In other words, Engineering, Sales, and whoever wanted to be there was also invited.)
						<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
							<p>The jam was meant to be just an exploration of TPRM; however, our research uncovered that the real root of the problem surrounding this next market venture was a then-neglected feature of the product: the questionnaire. We were able to prove that point and get questionnaires on the roadmap for the year, ultimately resulting in an updated questionnaire with release 8.3.</p>
