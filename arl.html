								<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
		<p>As a member of this research team, I worked alongside engineering-minded individuals to evaluate an Intelligent Team Tutoring System (ITTS). The Iowa State University team developed the system using software frameworks provided by the Army Research Lab. Based on a protocol used for an earlier iteration of the ITTS, I designed and managed the experiment.</p>

		<p>To the experimental surveys, I added an assessment of a team-related quality called collective efficacy. Additionally, I quizzed participants on their understanding of the task. The quiz assessed shared team cognition and gave extra insight into whether our participants were invested in their tasks.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, I improved upon the current record-keeping process, adding a notebook participant log. The paper log both served as a reminder for research assistants and eliminated version control from the logging process. During data collection, I supervised the efforts of six undergraduate researchers. We are currently analyzing the experiment’s data.</p>

								<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENTS</h3>
		<ul><li>Which software-related variables help or hinder the effectiveness of team tutors?</li>
		<li>Which personality variables help or hinder the effectiveness of team tutors?</li></ul>
								
								<h3>DATA COLLECTION</h3>
		<p>We collected data using a series of Qualtrics online surveys and a software framework, called GIFT, which logged key presses and times. I led eight research assistants in the collection of data from 39 three-person teams over the course of 20 weeks. Both the research team and the participants were scheduled by me for their sessions. Throughout the semester, I relayed experiment updates to the development team.</p>

								<h3>DATA ANALYSIS</h3>
		<p>Data analysis is still in its early stages and largely consists of data cleansing and organization. Using SPSS, RStudio, and Python, my team and I will create visualizations and perform statistical tests to solidify our understanding of the data.</p>

								<h4>Challenges</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Organizing a large team</li>
                    <p>As a new graduate student, I had (and still have) much to learn about coordinating a research effort. The fruits of my labor have yet to be realized, but I have little reason to doubt the integrity of the data collection methods.</p>
                   <li>Wrangling mass amounts of data</li>
                    <p>Data organization is never an easy task, but it is compounded when dealing with data in bulk. When I’ve previously organized data, I’ve been able to fall back on manual manipulation. However, due to the vast number of variables and data points, I had to rely much more on RStudio to recode the data.</p>
