							<h2>Digital Accessibility Website Redesign</h2>
						</header>

                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
		<p>I was chosen to be the user experience research for Iowa State University's Information Technology Services. My favorite project was in support of the redesign of the university's digital accessibility website. I worked with students, staff, and faculty at Iowa State to rework the information architecture and the voice of the page. I shared my findings with my team of designers and front-end developers to create a user-centered website. </p>

								<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
		<p>Digital accessibility is the process of designing content which is inclusive to the widest possible audience, regardless of capability, disability, or technology. In the United States, roughly 26% of the population lives with at least one disability, according to the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html">(1)</a>. That number doesn't include people who have had a disability nor people who have temporary disabilities, such as a sprained ankle or a broken arm, nor does it speak to other populations who benefit from digital accessibility, for example, someone who doesn't have the latest smartphone or someone trying to watch a video in a noisy airport. This website is meant to keep Iowa State University up-to-date on digital accessibility, which means that it should be thorough in terms of content, pleasant to use, and easy to understand.</p>

								<h3>DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS</h3>
		<p>Because the website had not been touched in a couple of years, I started from scratch on building an understanding of what content should be on the site. The site had not seen any web-traffic, so we did not have access to metadata about where people went when they visited. Therefore, the first step was to talk to people.</p>						
		
    <p>I used a brief survey to collect demographic information and self-reported knowledge about both accessibility and digital accessibility. The 5-minute survey was sent to the entire staff, faculty, and student population of Iowa State, and 735 of them responded. Of these, 208 respondents supplied their email and agreed to further involvement in the study.</p>
    
    <p>The survey revealed some interesting trends, as shown in Figure 2; however, none of the differences between groups are significant, and knowing that Iowa Stater's feel like they know very little about digital accessibility, on average, tells us nothing about how much they actually know. That information comes from actually having conversations around the topics of digital accessibility and digital content.</p>

Those who do not know someone tend to claim the next most knowledge about digital accessibility (M = 2.0; CI = 1.2, 3.0) followed by those who answer "maybe" to knowing someone with a disability (M = 1.9; CI = 1.1, 2.8)."/></span></div>

<p>Interviews were conducted with a sample of respondents who agreed to participate in future portions of the study. This sample was stratified by position at the university, according to the university's reported distribution of graduate and undergraduate students, staff and faculty. Additional care was taken to ensure the interviews included people with disabilities and people who indicated that they might have a disability. I talked to 17 people in total; two faculty, five staff, three graduate students, and seven undergraduates. Two people had identified as having a disability, seven indicated they might have a disability, and eight reported no disabilities.</p>

<p>By examining the transcripts and the notes taken during the interviews, some themes emerged. The most interesting of these was "Information Access." Most people mentioned something related to the need for equal access to information, and when someone really fixated on this interpretation of digital accessibility, they tended to have also reported not having a disability, themselves. This is not incorrect, digital accessibility is concerned with access to information (e.g., visual information, the internet, digitized coursework materials). This was not something that had originally crossed my mind, however, and it is certainly one direction my team and I can move with the voice of the digital accessibility website.</p>

<p>This theme is only one of many that are continuing to emerge as I dig into the data. The main focus of the interviews was to gather information that can be used in the next phase of this study which focuses on card sorting.</p>

								<h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
		<p>Research is currently on-going. The next step is to use an open card sort to identify a good structure for the information architecture of the website. From the results of the card sorts I am generating a low-fidelity prototype. This prototype will be tested by a few user experience/human-computer interaction experts at Iowa State University. These experts will be guided on a cognitive walkthrough of the prototype, and their suggestions will be used to update the prototype for use by the design-focused members of my team.</p>
                
                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Qualitative Research</li>
                    <p>I was first trained as a Quantitative Experimental Psychologist; I can build and evaluate a survey, no problem. Likert scale is my middle name. Even structured interviews come pretty naturally. This was the first project in which I used semi-structured interviews and observation protocols. Listening to my audio recordings and reading my transcripts has taught me much about what probing strategies work, which ones don't, and how to build rapport without taking over the conversation.</p>
                   <li>User testing methodology</li>
                    <p>I have used many user testing methods in other projects, but this was the first time I had full control over what I used to evaluate the needs of the users. I am still learning which methods are most appropriate for which situation, and how to properly create materials for use in those methods.</p>
                   </ol>
